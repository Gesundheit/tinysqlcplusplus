1.1	Software Requirement: 
MS Windows XP or higher, MS Visual Studio 2008 or higher.

1.2	Installation
1. Unzip the project file into a folder.
2. Open the folder; locate flex-bison-cpp-example.sln.
3. Open the sln file with MS Visual Studio.

1.3	Execution
1. Locate the src folder, which should be in the same directory as flex-bison-cpp-example.sln.
2. Go inside the src folder, locate exprtest.txt file.  This file contains the tinySQL script.  Feel free to add/modify/delete the script with grammatically correct tinySQL statements by opening that file with any text editor, including MS Visual Studio itself.
3. Once open the sln file with MS Visual Studio, click on F7, or Build -> Build Solution.  If the Output window indicates ¡§Build: 2 succeeded,¡¨ then proceed to next step; otherwise, please contact the members of this project.
4. Click on Control+F5, or Debug ->¡§Start without Debugging.¡¨
  The above step will execute the program and display all the outputs.  You should see a Windows Command-line Console with header such as cmd.exe as a pop-up.  This console window shows all the tinySQL execution result. 
Once the execution is done, you may click on the upper left of this console window, select ¡§Edit¡¨->¡§Select All,¡¨ then just click anywhere on this console window.  This will copy the entire output.
You may open a text file anywhere on your Windows system, click paste to output the captured information.
